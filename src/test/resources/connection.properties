#  If a proxy/load balancer injects additional cookies into responses,
#  like the AWS Application Load Balancer adding an "AWSALB" cookie for sticky sessions,
#  you can test for it by pointing the connection URL at the proxy and
#  adding the following into the connection.properties:
#  
#  expectedCookie=<injected cookie name>
#  
#  Sometimes these injected cookies are different for every request, so you
#  want to test that they are changing. To do so, add:
#  
#  uniqueCookieValue=true

#expectedCookie=poodle
